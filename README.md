# LocationTest
Requirements:
1) A location to be added requires 4 attributes (name, address, latitude, longitude)
2) Data must be readable and editable (CRUD operations)
3) Duplicate records are not allowed (A duplicate record is defined as a record which has the same attributes as another one)
4) Adding an address has to go through a geo-service since you might not always get the latitudes and longitudes
5) Front End is developed through angular, a basic UI for the specified requirements
6) Application written in C#
7) Geocode service of your own choice - Used Angulars geo service
8) Storage Option of your own choice - For this medior test i didn't see it that neccesary to use a database so i just edited the data-set text/json file
